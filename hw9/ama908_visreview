no of death by year
clarity: the title need to be bigger, 
it is a bit confusing that time (years) isn't any of the lables and it takes a while understanding what the 
plot is trying to convey. the colors are too brught so it make it hard to see read the labels 

aesthetic: I think that the colors chosen to show "no of deathes" quite do not fit and are too happy and pink :)
I think it is cool to be able to plot three diffrent attributes in one plot. One thinkg I found disturbing is 
taht the years showen are apearing upside down in the legend what make it very hard to relate. 
in an oposite chonological order 

honesty: I'm not sure because I don't know the data. The only cunclusion I can draw out of it is that diseas of
haert cuase more death. And I think that using other colors more similiar to each other could convey better the idea
(beacuse the years are the more monor issue here)
