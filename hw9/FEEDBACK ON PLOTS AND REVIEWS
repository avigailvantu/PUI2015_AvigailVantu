NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
================================

chizzino
=========

y axis extends above the data space

remove the empty space below 5 %

consider log space to cpmress the gaps and allow differences in the countries reporting small percentages to be seen

what is the legend on top? entirely not clear

labels for countries too small

top labels too small

=======
the differences year by year are tiny so it is hard to understand why they are highlighted as they are by color: it is what draws most of the attention and it is not the message that tries to be conveyed. 

axis labels too small

the units on the y axis should be compresses: use tens of thousands and plot single digit numbers

colors are lost by the 10% of the population that is color blind that cannot tell the difference between 2007 and 2008 etc

=======
a meaningful comparison is impossible due to the large difference in the men values. if that was the point then a time series would be unnecessary. if the structure should have been compared then a time series should have been modified by multiplying by an appropriate constant and indicating that in the legend 

small axes labels

the axis labels should be words, not variable names: startdate -> "start date (startdate)"
