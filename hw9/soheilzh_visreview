review for :sz1433  soheilzh
CLARITY:
I think this graph showes two really diffrent units (subway vs citibike) and the big amount of MTA riders make it
very hard to analyize any pattern in the citibike riders 
The labes are too small and not clear- 'startdate' can probably be repalced with day, date or just get ride of it and make 
the actual dates bigger. Also, no of entries only refers to subway and is very unclear for citibike riders, need to replace 
with a more clear and general label


ESTHETIC: 
other than the units and the need to normalize or 'zoom in' to see the citibikers pattern better I think it is a clear 
and easy way of ploting. very intuative to understand. About colors, red and blue are more associated with negative -positive 
things. It would be better to have two non symbolized colors. Also, I'm not sure if the visualization just tries to convey 
the diffrence in riders or is there another idea? 

HONESTY:
is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?
I think it is deforming the citibike data by shwoing it as constent BUT it is only constnet if you compare it to 
the mta riders (cuz there are so many more of them) and not if showing it on its on- then you'll find a big diffrence 
among the times, days, seaons as weve seen in class
