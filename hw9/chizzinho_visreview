review for lc3383  chizzinho plot 
Military spending by continent: 
CLARITY: 
The plot is very intuative, easy to read and clear. Only unclear thing is the top side of the plot shwoing points and labled 
spending in US$.
I like the removal of frame on both sides and making it almost "sparkline" 
THe units are great cuz there in %, so even if the continents spend an whole diffrent amount it is 
kinda normalized and make it comparable and well conveyed. 
You can see very easily patterns and trends- north america around 2000 is intresting and easy to detect


ESTHETIC: beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether y
ou think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to
communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represen
t the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or
are they distracting you?
the plot is very aesthetic. the lables are a bit too small 

HONESTY: 
I am not sure as I don;t now the data. but normalizing and shwoing data in precentage always disrots some of it and 
make it more readable. You lose the units and end up with a relative assumption.
Personaly I find the precetage a good way to visualize budgets but of course it is debatble
